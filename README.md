# Hello-World
Hey there :))

If I am sending one message... "I conceived and developed a new geometry of nature and implemented its use in a number of diverse fields. It describes many of the irregular and fragmented patterns around us, and leads to full-fledged theories, by identifying a family of shapes I call fractals.", Benoit Mandelbrot
